# Hi there, I'm Muhammad Noor! 👋

I'm a passionate computer science student, diving into the vast world of coding and constantly seeking opportunities for learning and growth. Here's a little bit about me:

- 👀 I’m interested in exploring various domains within computer science, from software development to artificial intelligence.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes of computer science at the University of Leeds, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that challenge my coding skills and allow me to learn from fellow developers. I believe in the power of collaboration to create something greater than the sum of its parts.
